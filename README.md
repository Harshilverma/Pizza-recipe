This is my Pizza recipe.
Recipe-
Step 1) In a bowl add warm water, sugar and yeast. Mix well and leave it at room temperature until the yeast gets activated.
Step 2) Now in a mixing bowl add maida, salt, oil and yeast mixture. Mix well and knead for at least 10 minutes. Initially the dough will be sticking to the hands after 10 minutes it will not stick. Coat with some oil and cover with a wet cloth and leave it at room temperature until it doubles in size. It takes approximately 1.30 to 2 hours.
Step 3) Once the dough is doubled in size give it a punch and transfer it to a work area. I am going to make 2 pizzas one for the oven and one for cooker. So i have cut them into 1 small and 1 large pizza ball.
Step 4) Spread the dough over a pizza pan and poke it with a fork to prevent the dough from rising while baking.
Step 5) spread a layer of pizza sauce, shredded mozzarella , cheddar cheese is optional (it gives nice color to the pizza. Then add onions, capsicum, mushroom and olives. Finally spread cheese on top and sprinkle some oregano.
Step 6) Bake it at 450 F / 230 C for 15 - 17 minutes. Similarly bake it in the cooker on high heat for 13 -15 minutes without the cooker weight.(preheat the cooker with a layer of salt on high flame for 15 minutes)
Serve the pizza while its hot. Spread the Joy of Cooking !!!
Thank You!!
